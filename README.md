A short level design

In this level, the player has crashed landed on this unknown alien planet which the goal is to collect 3 parts to fix your ship and get back home. Once all 3 parts has been collected and reached back to the ship, the player would have completed the level.

Key Controls: WASD, the basic movement where W is to move forward, A is to move left, S is to move backwards and D is to move to the right. Players will have to use their mouse to control the direction of where the player is looking. Players can also use the space bar to jump and the shift key to sprint.

There isn't really a game hack, but just collect all the parts and head back to the ship. This game is really easy to run, you can run it on windows and can just start playing.

Some limitations or bugs in my application is that the enemies do not fight, no damaging is allowed. Didn't really add much special effects or sound effects, which could be implemented.
